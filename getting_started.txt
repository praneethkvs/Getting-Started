Download git for Windows
Create a repo form the website myrepo
open git bash

cd ~/ #Change Directory to C:/Users/Admin

makedir myrepo # Create a directory with name same as the repository name on the github website

cd myrepo #Change directory to "myrepo" folder

#Now that we are in the myrepo folder the important work begins.

git init #Initiates a github repository
	 #Adds a .git subfolder to your myrepo folder thus initializing an empty git repository

git status #Shows any files and folders in the myrepo directory
	   #Initially we have nothing to commit

now we can create a new file from bash directly or copy a file and place it in the myrepo folder

touch readme.txt #Creates a readme.txt file

git status #This now shows us all the files in the myrepo folder as untracked files, i.e githb is ignoring the files

git add readme.txt #This adds the file readme.txt and now git recognizes the file

git commit -m "Add file readme.txt" #this command commits the file to the git repo
				    #-m flag tells git to treat text following text as a message 

#Tells githb that there is a remote directory which should mirror the local directoy myrepo
#username is the username you have given when you created your github account
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/myrepo.git 

#git has now established a connection between the local myrepo directory and the remote repo
#we can confirm this using the following command
#we see two origins i.e we are able to get information and push to the remote repo
git remote -v

#If the url is incorrect use the following command to set it to the correct one
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/myrepo.git


#The final command to push the changes made to our local repo to the remote repository	
git push origin master

#The command line will output a few lines of code and if you do not get an error you are done
#Now go visit yor github repository page and Voila your files should be there
