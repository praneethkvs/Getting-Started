Create a GitHub account by Signing up from the following url : "https://github.com/".
Download git for Windows from the following url : "https://git-scm.com/downloads".

First thing we need to do after signing in to the website is to create a new repository using the green "New repository" button.
Type in the repository name, let's call it "myrepo", leave everything else blank and hit "Create repository".
We have now created a new repository in your github account, aah but there is nothing there, it's completely empty.
Well then let's dive in deep.

Now open "Git Bash" that you have just installed on your computer.
This should bring up a command terminal.
Let's get coding.

#The first thing we need to do is introduce ourselves to git, Run the following Commands
git config --global user.name "your_username_here"
git config --global user.email "your_email_here"

#Now that git knows who we are, we can start creating a new repository.

#First thing we need to do is change our working directory to "C:/Users/Admin".
cd ~/ 

#Now we create a new directory, let's call it "myrepo" just to match the name of the repository we have previosly created on the website. 
makedir myrepo

#Change directory to "myrepo" folder.
cd myrepo 

#Now that we are in the myrepo folder, we can start with the "git" commands.
#We use the following command to intitate a git repository, the command adds a .git subfolder to your myrepo folder thus initializing an empty git repository.
git init

#Shows the status of your repository i.e; files and folders in the myrepo directory.
#Initially we have nothing to commit and hence it shows the same.
git status 

#Now we can create a new file from bash directly or copy a file and place it in the myrepo folder
#The "touch" command creates a new file in the current directory
touch readme.txt 

#This now shows us all the files in the myrepo folder but they are labelled as untracked files, i.e githb is ignoring the files.
git status 

#This adds the file readme.txt and now git recognizes the file and acknowledges it.
git add readme.txt 

#This command commits the file to the git repository.
#-m flag tells git to treat text following it as a message.
git commit -m "Add file readme.txt"  

#Now we need to tell git that there is a remote directory on the github website which should mirror the local repository "myrepo".
#To do this we use the following command and point it to the url of the remote repository.
#Here replace "username" with your github username without the quotes.
git remote add origin https://github.com/"username"/myrepo.git 



#git has now established a connection between the local myrepo directory and the remote repository.
#we can confirm this using the following command.
git remote -v

#we see two origins i.e we are able to get information and push to the remote repository.
#If by mistake you have entered an incorrect url, use the following command to set it to the correct one.
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/myrepo.git


#Lastly we need to update the changes made to our local repository and mirror these changes in the remote repository.	
#For this we use the "push" command.
git push origin master

#The command line will output a few lines of code and if you do not get an error you are done.
#Now go visit yor github repository page and Voila your files should be there.
